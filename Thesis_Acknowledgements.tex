I want to thank my thesis adviser, Prof. Daniel Gon√ßalves for his support, vision and guidance that helped me to accomplish this work.

I also thank my family for all of their support, patience and for bearing with me through this long path.

A very special thanks to my dearest friends who have been with me through all this time, both providing good and serious moments that have shaped a better person out of me.
