The chosen system for the photo display was Microsoft's Silverlight for it's DeepZoom functionality. This technology enables the use of multiple resolution images for efficient display at various zoom levels and, for instance, is used for the display of gigapixel photos, where the user can view the full-size image or zoom in the details or for collections of photos where zooming enables the user to view a full-size image or even its details. So far, usages of DeepZoom have been restricted to promotion websites, art galleries and other closed usages. Our work aims at bringing this techology to the regular user but without the complexity of manually creating the collections while offering more information about the images.

Before sticking with Silverlight, we looked around for other works but none gave the flexibility of DeepZoom.

Although DeepZoom has a few nice features, Silverlight itself isn't as good as using a full-fledged desktop application framework like Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or similars. It was designed for the web and not for desktop use. On the web it's similar to Adobe Flash, both being like a blackbox inside HTML, but Adobe has created Air that enables Flash-based applications to run like normal desktop applications. -There's nothing like this on Silverlight and therefore there's always a notable difference-
