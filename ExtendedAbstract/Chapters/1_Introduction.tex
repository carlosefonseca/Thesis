The growth of the digital brings the problem that photo collections have started to grow more than they used to. But storing digital photographs isn't that different from the past. There's currently no good way to have a global view of the collection, understanding its evolution and characteristics.
We propose that visualizing photographs in a birds-eye view, with a number of different ways to organize, group, sort and filter them by using features like events or dates, dominant color or people in photos will provide users a much more satisfying experience of discovery of their libraries.
To demonstrate this, we implemented Eagle Eye, a system that allows users to do just that. After testing, we observed that our approach allows users to navigate and explore their photo libraries in a whole new way, revealing patterns or evolution over time, while enjoying their photos.
