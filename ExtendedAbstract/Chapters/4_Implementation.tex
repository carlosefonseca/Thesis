Eagle Eye is the product of this thesis and is our implementation of the requirements previously detailed. It is a visualization tool that enables the display and manipulation of a large image set at once. It is focused at the regular computer user that has a few thousand digital photographs stored on the computer. It allows navigation, through panning and zooming of the canvas where the image collection is disposed, sorting in different ways while also allowing filtering, either textual or visual.


\subsection{Overview}

The system is now composed of two main elements: the Backend, which is the system that extracts features from the images and prepares everything to be displayed; and the Visualization which performs the display from the images and their extracted features to the user.
