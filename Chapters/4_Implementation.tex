Eagle Eye is a visualization tool that enables the display and manipulation of a large image set at once. It is focused at the regular computer user that has a few thousand digital photographs stored on the computer. It allows navigation, through panning and zooming the canvas of the image collection, sorting through different methods and multiple ways of filtering, either textual or visual.
