\section{Visualization} % (fold)
\label{sub:visualization}

The greatest challenge of this work was the creation of the visualization part for its requirements. We will now describe this part of Eagle Eye, its architecture, visualization techniques, sorting and filtering capabilities.

\subsection{Overview}
We wanted to make the visualization simple and easy to use, while keeping it flexible enough to allow for an enjoyable experience.

After the backend has finished the all the processing that is needed, the visualization can be opened and all images that were added to the backend's processing list will appear. After loading the metadata, the user is presented with a set of options on the top toolbar, which is the only \ac{UI} needed to use the system. \todo{Add picture}

According to \todo{insert the reference of the dude who claimed that a 32x32px image was the minimum for recognition}, an image with 32 pixels per side is the minimum size that allows a user to recognize an image.

\red{Unsure about how well this fits hereâ€¦} Upon loading Eagle Eye's visualization system, thousands of images might be displayed and this 32 pixel might not be met and, therefore, it might be difficult for the user to recognize what is on display from a single image, but since a lot of them are being displayed, the user might be capable of making sense of the groups by their main colors.

\subsubsection{The Canvas}

The canvas is the most relevant part of the visualization as it dynamically displays all the images previously selected by the user, at the same time. This may make the images barely recognizable and, therefore, the user has the possibility of manipulating the canvas to see and enjoy the images.
This means that the user can, at any time, use the mouse to drag the canvas around or, by clicking or scrolling, zoom in and out of the canvas. Zooming goes from the default view of thousands of images at the same time, until the full screen view of one of them, and everything in between in a smooth way.

\subsubsection{The toolbar}

The user can then use the functions on the toolbar to filter and sort differently. The toolbar is divided in three sections: Navigation, Display and Filtering.

The navigation section contains some basic functions that work similarly to the current web browsers. There are buttons for back and forward between display states and a save button for bookmarking the current display state, allowing the user to easily get back to it later.

The middle section contains two options to change the image display:  the sorting options and the display overlays button. The former presents the available sorting options for the current collection, based on the available metadata and on the best ways to display them. One of the options is selected at all times and the content is presented accordingly. Changing the selected option causes the images in display to move around to the new position and form a different sort order. This sorting and disposition options will be explained in a later section.
The other button in the display section of the toolbar enables or disables a layer of information on top of the images. This layer distinguishes the groups of images in display by painting them with a different colors and presents a name for them, depending on the selection sort option. Grouping will also be explained bellow. 

The third and final section of the toolbar is the filter section. It contains controls to filter images by using simple text and to visually select images on the canvas. This options will also be explained bellow.

\subsection{Disposition of Images on Canvas}

The different ways to dispose the images on the canvas was a matter that required some exploration of possibilities \refs. We chose a few options to allow some flexibility for the user, while trying to keep the interface simple.

We are now going to explain how do we sort images into groups and the different ways the user can arrange those groups on the canvas.

\subsubsection{Sorting images into groups}

As we've seen, the backend outputs metadata for each image. This metadata is loaded into the visualization application of Eagle Eye and is indexed by their type.

For instance, each image has an associated creation timestamp which will be aggregated by days, generating an image group for each day.

Similarly, the mean color associated with each image is indexed and groups are generated by dividing the hue spectrum in bins \todo{specify which and add the spectrum image}.

Another option is the grouping by device name, which usually allows to distinguish between who took the pictures if, for instance, different people have different cameras on the same event.

The last option currently available to the user is grouping by path which groups together the images that were already grouped by the user, on the file system. This allows for the display of an organization that is recognizable to the user, which can make a good starting point.

On the canvas, group boundaries are identifiable by discrete gray borders and, when the Show Overlays function is active, by color rectangles that also contain the groups' names.


\subsubsection{Different dispositions}

After having the images grouped by any of the sorting options referred on the previous section, the system has to know how to display them on the canvas.

We looked into various options \refs and picked the ones that we thought that made sense and also that would be easier for the user to understand. We chose a tree map view and a column-based linear view. Both of these are grid-based layouts, meaning that images are positioned inside a defined grid on the canvas. We also looked into free positioning systems like \refs but they make it harder for the user to understand the images within, since some images will be covered by others. When displaying thousands of images, it's important to make them easy to see, and mixing them up wasn't the appropriate thing to do. We focused on other ways for making it easier to the user see what matters and we will talk about them later on.

The first layout technique we employed was the tree map. The problem with tree maps is that they are designed for areas that can take many forms, from squares to thin lines \todo{insert tree map image}. Applying tree maps to images calls for the adaptation of the algorithms to make sure the areas can correctly hold the images and that all images in all groups have the same size and are positioned in the same grid, to make them easier to view. This ideas are supported by \todo{gajo} on his work in the Quantum treemaps. We tried to apply Quantum tree maps as our tree map algorithm but due to it's complexity and recurring problems, we adapted the tree maps of \todo{gajo}, as used in Prefuse \todo{verify} \refs to the reality of the image grid. This new algorithm was much easier to understand and implement, although  it might require a small fine running for a couple of edge cases.

Our tree map algorithm displays larger groups first, leaving the smaller ones to the end and makes an effort to layout groups as rectangles with an aspect ratio as close as possible to the screen's aspect ratio, for when the user zooms in, the groups fill the screen. There's also an effort to fill the space left between larger groups, making the display more compact and with less holes.

One problem of the tree map display is that group sequence is irrelevant. Groups are positioned by their size, which is unacceptable for sorting options that require some sequence, like sorting by time. For this we created a linear display that uses columns and displays groups sequentially. Each group may fill part of a column or various columns, depending on their size. With the aim of reducing wasted space, groups that fit on the wasted space left by the previous group use that space to display themselves. This is useful  to collapse the couple pictures the user might take of his regular day between days that he went on a trip and took a much larger number of photographs.

Currently we are using this layout system only for the date display since the use of columns makes visualization harder, requiring either some panning around the canvas or selecting the group using the filter tools explained ahead. This is an area we must improve, and we will discuss some ideas later on.


\subsubsection{Filtering} % (fold)

In addition to the sorting options explained above, Eagle Eye also provides the user with the ability to filter images. This allows the user to focus on a specific group of pictures that are his focus of interest at the moment.

For instance, the user might want to only see photos of a day, or a person, or person in a specific day or even pictures that are mostly blue.

For all this, Eagle Eye provides two ways to specify this kinds of constraints: using the filter bar or selecting pictures on the canvas, and we will now look into both them.

The filter bar's purpose mimics a regular search box, similar to the ones that exist on applications like Internet browsers, file browsers or photo browsers \refs: it provides a way for the user to type what he is looking for and get some suggestions to help him with the search. Since we wanted a simple \ac{UI}, we figured that we had to provide smart suggestions to the user, so that he can feel comfortable using it for multiple types of searches. Searches are performed immediately upon selecting the desired filter. Currently, searches are intersections (commonly ``and'') of the entries in the filter bar but after adding adequate \ac{UI}, it will be possible to also use unions (commonly ``or'').

Every piece of the metadata can be used as a filter and the suggestions list shows what are the available options and what type of metadata they relate to, for instance, when looking for a person's name, the ``keyword'' metadata type is shown, when searching for a place, both ``keyword'' and ``path'' types might be presented, if the path to the pictures included the place where they were taken.

This examples are quite simple but we wanted to go further and allow searches like ``Summer'', for all photos taken around the summer time in all years, ``May 2010``, for all pictures taken during that month, ``Has 2 people'' for photos that have been detected to have people in them. \red{Although some of these have not been implemented yet, they are in the plans.}

The second filter method allows the manual selection of images from the canvas, either by a common mouse drag-and-drop on the canvas or by selecting entire groups with a mouse click. This two interaction options can be activated on the respecting button on the end of the toolbar. 

As explained above, the filter bar intersects its elements immediately after being added but that kind of behavior would make it impossible for the user to make multiple selections, so this feature gathers the various selections and when the user forces the filtering, all the selections are gathered together and added to the rest of the filter.

\red{Since the selections are displayed in the same way text filters are, the removal of a selection is made in the same way.}
