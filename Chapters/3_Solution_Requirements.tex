\todo{Fix bellow}

Our survey was based on various types of previous work from the last ten years. Image browsers and technology have evolved a lot since then but there still isn't a definitive way for a user to look at his photo collection and understand its content and evolution. 

We have the vision of a system that displays a large set of userâ€™s photos at the same time, in various arrangements, revealing patterns, differences and similarities between them.

For this to happen, the system must be able to handle thousands of images and display them all on the screen while maintaining responsiveness and giving useful information. The system's \ac{UI} should be clear and easy to use, allowing the user to navigate through the display of photos, through zooming and panning, and to reorganize the display the photos in a number of ways.

The system should also gather as much information as it can from the photos, such as date and time, relevant colors, presence of people, type of photograph, user organization or location. While some of this information is already embedded in today's digital photographs as metadata, written by the digital camera when the photo was taken, others are usually not and need to be calculated or extracted. Faces and relevant color information are an example of that and the system must be prepared to extract this features from the image. The system must provide some capability for other feature extraction methods to be easily added in the future. All this information will then be used by the user to reorganize and filter the photos on display.


We will now detail the work done, taking this requirements into account.
